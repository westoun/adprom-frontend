# ADPROM Web App

ADPROM, short for Advanced Project Management Tool, was my attempt to keep track of my different side projects through, well, another side project. 
Back then, in my early days as a web developer, I considered it a wise move to ignore all existing (and working!) solutions and build one myself.
Although I ended up never actually using ADPROM, I learned a lot along the way and decided to upload my code as a future reference on how it _could_ be done.


Details on my journey with ADPROM can be found in [this](https://medium.com/@christoph.werner.stein/what-happens-when-motivation-tries-to-outrun-reality-ea49337e4796#10e5-e3d8106acb91) medium post.



## Installation

Before getting started, make sure you have Node and npm installed. Instructions on how to do so can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

Run `npm install` to install any missing packages and dependencies.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
